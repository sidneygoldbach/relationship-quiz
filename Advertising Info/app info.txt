How Advice is Displayed:

- After completing the quiz and payment, users see their personality type result along with two types of advice :
  1. 1.
     Personality Advice (5 items per type) - focused on personal growth and self-awareness
  2. 2.
     Relationship Advice (5 items per type) - focused on improving relationships and interactions
Scoring Logic (Like a Coach/Counselor): The system uses a sophisticated weighted scoring approach:

- Each answer option has personality weights (e.g., {communicator: 3, independent: 1} )
- User answers accumulate points for different personality types
- The personality type with the highest total score determines the result
- All scores and percentages are calculated and stored for detailed analysis
Advice Selection:

- Users receive exactly 10 pieces of advice (5 personality + 5 relationship)
- Advice is pre-written and curated for each of the 5 personality types:
  - The Communicator
  - The Nurturer
  - The Harmonizer
  - The Independent
  - The Loyalist
Professional Approach: The system follows counseling/coaching principles:

- Evidence-based : Uses weighted scoring across multiple behavioral dimensions
- Holistic : Covers both personal development and relationship skills
- Actionable : Each advice item provides specific, implementable guidance
- Balanced : Acknowledges strengths while suggesting growth areas
The advice is comprehensive and professionally crafted, similar to what you'd receive from a relationship counselor, with specific guidance tailored to your dominant personality pattern based on your quiz responses.
